## Description
The **Geographic Name Proposal App** is a web-based application prototype designed as part of a student project to streamline the process of submitting proposals for changes to domestic geographic names. This app, if adopted, can help modernize the existing paper-based process managed by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN), a branch of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). 

The app leverages the **ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript** to provide an interactive web map where users can explore geographic place data from Esri and USGS public REST services. Additionally, the app integrates a digital form developed using **Esri Survey123**, allowing users to submit proposals directly through the app. This prototype was developed as part of the **Geospatial Web and Mobile Programming** course at the University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison.

## Features
- **Interactive Web Map**: Displays geographic place data using USGS GNIS and Esri REST services.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for geographic places with suggestions and results limited for better usability.
- **Coordinate Display**: A coordinate widget shows the latitude and longitude of the user's cursor position on the map.
- **Survey123 Integration**: A digital form embedded in the app allows users to submit proposals for geographic name changes.
- **Custom Basemap**: Utilizes the USGS Topographic Map as the base layer for the map.
- **Pop-ups for Layers**: Displays detailed information about geographic places and physical features in a table format.

## Dependencies
- **ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript**: For creating interactive visualizations and widgets.
- **USGS GNIS REST Services**: Provides publicly available geographic place data.
- **Esri Survey123**: For embedding the proposal submission form.
- **GitHub Pages**: For hosting the web application.
